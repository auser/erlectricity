==
  * Backward Incompatible Changes
    * Implicit array call for f.when(:echo, String) must now be called as
      f.when([:echo, String]) to eliminate ambiguity
    * The receive loop now defaults to using file descriptors 3 and 3
      instead of STDIN and STDOUT. This prevents inadvertent output
      statements from silently corrupting the transfer protocol.
    * Erlang atoms 'true' and 'false' are now converted into Ruby booleans
  * Major Enhancements
    * Calling `rake` now runs tests (with and without compiled C extensions)
    * Package management is now done by Jeweler
